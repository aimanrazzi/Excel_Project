Welcome to my Excel Projects Repository! üìù‚ú®

This repository showcases my work with Microsoft Excel, including data analysis, visualization, and problem-solving techniques. Each project highlights practical applications of Excel functions, formulas, and tools, such as Power Query, charts, and advanced data manipulation. Please go to folder [Project_1-Dashboard](./Excel_Data_Analytics_Course-main/Project_1-Dashboard) and [Project_2-Analysis](./Excel_Data_Analytics_Course-main/Project_2-Analysis) to view the project that I've done. 


Whether you're here to learn, explore, or collaborate, I hope you find these projects insightful and inspiring. Feel free to dive in and share your feedback!
